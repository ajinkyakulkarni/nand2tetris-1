My implementation of the projects included in the book [The Elements of Computing Systemsâ€”Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](http://www.nand2tetris.org), by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

This repository only contains the source files. The tools and test files are available for download on the book's website.

Note: the CPUEmulator does not work with Java 1.6 that ships with OS X El Capitan. You can check your Java version by running `java -version`, and install a more recent version by running `brew update && brew cask install java`.
